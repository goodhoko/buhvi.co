# Jan Koutný
Young backend developer based in Prague with a flair for hard problems.

## What I'm good at
- **Learning** has always been my top strength. I'm fast at understanding complex problems and I genuinely enjoy it. I'm always seeking new stuff to wrap my head around.
- Due to this craving for the knowledge I always try to **understand how things work**. When I use some tools, language, paradigm, etc. I get to know how it works hence I can deduce what are the right ways to use it. I avoid blindly moving stuff around until it works.
- **I'm not a coding robot.** When I'm tasked with a job I must know its purpose. I can question, contradict or extend the task if it doesn't seem sensible or complete.
- Technologies I'm fluent in include Kotlin, PHP, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP, (My)SQL, Elasticsearch, GIT, WordPress, Javascript.

## What I'm not good at
- **Quickly bodging dirty solutions** is definitely not my forte.
- **Estimating time and effort** needed to finish a task is a skill I both need and want to improve.
- Although I've been doing it in my past jobs **managing people** is an area I could be much better in.

## Stuff I've done
For the last 3 years, I've been working at a fresh Czech startup [GoOut.net](https://goout.net/). It's a cultural guide, ticket selling solution, and social network. I grew there from writing my first simple PHP scripts to deploying complex backend services gaining most of my practical skills along the way. Here are some projects I did there:

### Social Feed
I've designed, written and deployed a microservice that provides users with a personal news feed. Check it out! Its output is visible right on the [front page](https://goout.net/). Technically it's a Spring microservice written in Kotlin. Elasticsearch is used as data storage and the whole thing is deployed in Kubernetes on GKE.

### Facebook Event Scrapper
Some time ago Facebook closed their Events API. That was quite a bummer for GoOut as we need to know all the cultural events so I built an automatic scrapper using Selenium. It emulates a user traversing facebook pages scraping events along the way. Again it runs as a dockerized application in our Kubernetes cluster and uses Elasticsearch for storage. Since its deployment, it has scrapped tens of thousands of events. But, please, don't tell Facebook. .)

### Other Projects at GoOut
I've migrated many parts of our old monolithic architecture to Kubernetes microservices. I've built [several](https://coloursselection.cz/cs/) [websites](https://mestanskabeseda.cz/) for [cultural](https://www.divadlobolkapolivky.cz/) [venues](https://palladium.pl/en/) on WordPress. I've initiated usage of Kafka throughout our architecture. Lastly, I passed what I gained to over 10 freshman programmers who joined GoOut later.

### Previous Jobs
GoOut is my first real programming job. Prior that (during high school) I was fulfilling my enthusiasm at [Rekola](https://www.rekola.cz/) where I grew from bicycle mechanic to a 'Prague Sherrif' coordinating bike-sharing traffic across the whole city. Bicycles are a big part of my life and I still occasionally do custom bike building for friends.

### Education
- Bachelor in Knwoledge Engineering at [Faculty of Information Technology](https://fit.cvut.cz/en) of [Czech Technical University](https://www.cvut.cz/en) (2015 - 2019)
- Math focused class at [Gymnázium Christiana Dopplera](https://gchd.cz/) highschool (2010 - 2015)

## Stuff I'd like to do
I'm interested in literally anything requiring hard thinking, research and learning. Finding solutions is the fun part although I'm not scared of the subsequent coding labor. Especially high-velocity high-tech web applications is what intrigues me.
