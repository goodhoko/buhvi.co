## Skills
Technologies I consider myself to be fluent in include Kotlin, JS/TS, PHP, git, bash, Docker, Kubernetes, Elastic Search, SQL, Google Cloud Platform, Electron...

## Interests
I started playing with Rust and I believe it's the language I want to learn next. It seems like and ideal tool for getting closer to the metal.

I like to balance my software day job by doing a lot of manual work in my free time. Currently, I'm building a camper van from the ground up. I [build bicycles](https://zadnyspe.ch/tags/stavba-kol/) and sometimes [other stuff](https://zadnyspe.ch/tags/handwork/). I'd really like to work on an embedded project in my next job to bridge the hardware and software worlds.

Other than that I ride bicycles a lot, sometimes do some track&field races (1500 - 5000 m), [shoot analog](https://photos.app.goo.gl/c7gePUvpRWoE9CCw9), paraglide, rock climb, enjoy good music or [trainhop](https://zadnyspe.ch/tags/nakladni-vlaky/).
